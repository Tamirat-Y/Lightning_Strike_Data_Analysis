# Lightning Strike Data Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analysis of lightning strike data from 2016 to 2018, sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Spatial and temporal patterns were examined to uncover high-risk hotspots, seasonal trends, and annual fluctuations in lightning activity. A dataset comprising over 13 million records was processed, with visualizations generated to highlight geographical concentrations and time-based trends. Notably, regions in Cuba and the southern United States emerged as consistent lightning hotspots, with peak activity observed during the summer months. Insights from this analysis offer valuable support for weather monitoring, disaster mitigation, and climate-related research initiatives.

## **Insights**

* **Dataset Overview**

  > * The 2018 dataset contains **3.4 million** records across **170,855 unique locations**, capturing daily lightning strike counts.
  > * When combined with 2016 and 2017 data, the **union dataset totals 13.88 million records** and 12 columns.

* **Top Lightning Activity Locations (2018)**

  > * The **highest single-day strike counts** occurred in the southern U.S., particularly near **Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri**.
  > * **Cuba** emerged as the most consistently active lightning zone overall, especially areas near **Pinar del Río and Havana**, which appeared across all top location analyses:

    >> * Highest daily strikes
    >> * Most strike days
    >> * Highest total strikes

* **Seasonal Patterns**

   * Across all three years, **lightning activity peaked in summer months**—particularly **July, August, and June**.
   * There’s a **clear seasonal trend**:

   >  * **Q3 (July–September)** had the **highest activity**
    > * Followed by **Q2**, **Q1**, and **Q4** (lowest activity)
  > * Winter months (Q4) showed minimal lightning activity, confirming the influence of heat and humidity on thunderstorm frequency.

* **Consistent Hotspots Across Years**

   > * Locations in **Cuba**—especially around **POINT(-84.2 22.4)** and **POINT(-82.3 22.9)**—consistently ranked among the top 10 for lightning strikes each year.
   > * This consistency suggests **stable meteorological patterns or geographic features** favorable to lightning formation in those areas.

* **Annual Trends**

   > * A striking spike in 2018: **89.2 million strikes**, compared to **35.1 million in 2017** and **41.6 million in 2016**.
   > * This could indicate:

    >>  * A major **weather anomaly in 2018**
    >>  * **Improved data collection or detection**
     >> * **Expansion of monitored areas**



## **Recommendations**

* **Further Investigate Cuba’s Lightning Activity**

   > * Conduct **meteorological or atmospheric studies** to understand why certain Cuban regions show consistently high lightning counts.
   > * Consider infrastructure protection and early warning systems in these high-risk areas.

* **Monitor and Validate the 2018 Spike**

  >  * Assess whether the 2018 increase is due to **natural causes**, **expanded detection networks**, or **changes in data collection methods**.

* **Leverage Seasonal Patterns for Preparedness**

  >  * Utilize the **Q2–Q3 peak activity trend** to develop seasonal **alert systems and public safety protocols**, especially in tropical and subtropical regions.

* **Visualize Hotspots with Geographic Context**

   > * Create **heatmaps or interactive maps** showing persistent hotspots across years to support urban planning, disaster preparedness, and risk mitigation.

* **Integrate with Climate Data**

  >  * Correlate lightning strike trends with climate indicators like **temperature, humidity, El Niño patterns, and precipitation** for deeper insights.

* **Consider Expanding Data Scope**

  >  * Include more metadata such as **storm severity, time of day, or satellite identifiers** to enhance future predictive modeling.
